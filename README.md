Data science techniques on Indian stock market data NSE

This file is my attempt to draw useful conclusions regarding overnight and intraday returns in the Indian Stock market.
The data is imported from python library nsepy for nifty50 index as well as midcap and smallcap indices.

The notebook has a function which calculates the daily return schedule for the indices to identify if the stock market advances or declines relatively more frequently on a particular day of the week.

It also plots the histogram to show the return distribution as well as boxplots of the volume distribution on yearly basis which indicates that volume in the stock market has increased signficantly in 2018-19

The notebook also shows that major portion of the returns in the Indian stock market are overnight rather than intraday , with the intraday returns being negative 7 out of 10 years. This shows that the stocks infact do make money overnight!
